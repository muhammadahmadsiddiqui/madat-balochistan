      <h1>How we do it?</h1>
      <p>
        We do this through climate education in educational institutions,
        increasing political participation by protesting, hosting gatherings
        for advocates and utilizing social media to share best practices.
        These include strategies for organizing and responding to climate
        disasters. We use our platform to amplify other collectives in the
        country, and to uplift the voices of young people in different
        regions.

                    <h2>Balochistan Flood Relief 2022: A Story of Resilience and Hope</h2>
                    <p>In 2022, Pakistan was ravaged by megafloods, displacing over 33 million people and disrupting countless lives. In our community, over 4,000 members were forced to camp on a canal bank, exposed to the elements with no support. This dire situation sparked a sense of urgency, and we launched an online mutual aid campaign to provide emergency assistance. We raised over $120,000 for flood relief in climate-disaster vulnerable regions through mutual aid on online platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and GoFundMe. This effort impacted more than 31,000 lives. Our campaign focused on the most vulnerable: women, widows, menstruating girls, disabled individuals, pregnant and lactating women, and minority communities often overlooked due to gender and cultural norms. As word spread, hundreds of requests poured in from flood-affected people across Pakistan, and we expanded our support to 34 districts.</p>

                    <h2>Sindh Flood Relief 2022</h2>
                    <p>In 2022, the unprecedented floods in Sindh left a trail of destruction, displacing thousands and shattering lives. The catastrophic event, triggered by heavy monsoon rains, affected over 3 million people across the province. The floods submerged entire villages, destroying homes, crops, and infrastructure, leaving families without shelter, food, or access to basic necessities. Amidst the chaos, Madat Balochistan stood tall, providing a beacon of hope to those affected. We distributed blankets to over 200 families, ensuring they had a warm and comfortable place to sleep. Ration bags were provided to over 250 families, sustaining them through the darkest hours. We also distributed 60+ menstrual hygiene kits, upholding the dignity and well-being of women in crisis. Empowering women was a key focus, as we gifted 5 sewing machines to entrepreneurial women, enabling them to rebuild their livelihoods. Additionally, a shop was established for a local woman, fostering economic growth and self-sufficiency. However, the floods also exposed the dire state of healthcare infrastructure in Pakistan. Many government hospitals lacked essential medicines, leaving countless people without access to proper medical care. To bridge this gap, Madat Balochistan organized a medical camp, providing critical healthcare services to those in need. Over 500 individuals benefited from our medical camp, receiving vital treatment and care. Our team of dedicated healthcare professionals worked tirelessly to address the urgent medical needs of the affected communities.</p>

                    <h2>Gwadar floods 2024</h2>
                    <p>In late February 2024, Gwadar, a coastal city in Pakistan, was ravaged by torrential downpours, unleashing catastrophic flooding that submerged key areas, including Gwadar city and Surbandan. The unrelenting rainfall, totaling 180 millimeters over two days, triggered flash floods, displacing residents and causing widespread destruction. The devastating impact was palpable: over 500 homes and vital roads were destroyed, leaving families without shelter or access to basic necessities. Residents were swiftly evacuated to government rest houses, but tragedy struck when a child was injured in a wall collapse. In response to the dire situation, Madat Balochistan swiftly mobilized to assist the affected population. An online fundraising campaign raised an impressive 1,227,372 PKR in donations from local people, enabling our team to deliver critical aid. Our team responded swiftly, distributing essential resources to those affected. These resources included 1,500 ready-made food boxes, 30 ration bags, 400 first aid kits, 50 packs of children's diapers, 200 shawls, 200 blankets, 700 articles of clothing, 200 new children's outfits for Eid celebration, 50 hygiene kits, and 2 de-watering pumps. Madat Balochistan's dedicated team worked tirelessly, providing more than just survival essentials.</p>

                    <h2>Balochistan Climate Camp 2024</h2>
                    <p>Madat Balochistan, co-founded and led by 17-year-old climate activist Nafeesa Baloch, proudly presents its groundbreaking initiative, the first-ever Climate Camp in Balochistan. This pioneering effort aimed to educate and raise awareness about climate change, promoting sustainable development in the region. The Climate Camp was a response to Balochistan's vulnerability to climate change, addressing the need for climate education and awareness. The region faces numerous challenges, including poverty, political instability, and climate change. Annual floods, droughts, and heatwaves are often dismissed as natural disasters rather than climate emergencies. The camp's objectives were to educate youth about climate change and its impacts, build organizational capacity and global leadership skills, and promote sustainable development and community-based initiatives. These objectives align with global climate goals and local needs. Over 70 youths from across Pakistan attended the 3-day camp, participating in interactive sessions, workshops, and activities. The agenda included climate change awareness, sustainable development, and leadership skills training. Innovative approaches, such as handprinted painting and chart-making, facilitated group discussions and debates. Collaborations with organizations like Pak Navy Cadet College, Youth Climate Activist Pakistan, Dast-e-Khuddam, and Booni Environmental Academy provided expertise, support, and resources. The camp achieved its objectives, empowering youth to become climate leaders and change-makers. Success stories include increased awareness, community-based initiatives, and leadership development.</p>

                    <h2>Activist roundtable LHE 2024</h2>
                    <p>In September 2024, Quantum Verse Lab and the Prime Minister Youth Program (PMYP) successfully organized Pakistan's inaugural climate activist roundtable in Lahore, a timely and crucial initiative addressing the country's pressing environmental concerns. Madat Balochistan was honored to collaborate with these esteemed organizations and support their efforts. Pakistan's vulnerability to climate change necessitates urgent collective action. Rising temperatures, devastating floods, and droughts have severe impacts on livelihoods, health, and the economy. The consequences of inaction are dire, making it imperative for diverse stakeholders to come together and strategize effective solutions. The roundtable brought together 30+ diverse delegates from across Pakistan, fostering open dialogue and multi-perspective debate. The Observers' Gallery added valuable insights, ensuring practical solutions were discussed and meaningful outcomes achieved. Quantum Verse Lab's commitment to research-driven innovation and PMYP's empowering 4Es initiative - Education, Employment, Engagement, and Environment - created a dynamic platform for change.
                        Madat Balochistan extends its gratitude to Q Lab and PMYP for inviting us to collaborate and amplifying our voices. Our volunteers proudly represented Balochistan at the roundtable, ensuring the region's voice was heard. Our female activists continue to drive change and inspire action, demonstrating their unwavering dedication to environmental justice. The roundtable discussions focused on critical topics, including green economy, climate action, advocacy strategies, practical solutions, partnerships, and content strategies.</p>
